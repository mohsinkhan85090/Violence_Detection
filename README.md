Violence Detection System

A Machine Learning–based system for detecting violent activity in video clips using motion analysis and feature extraction techniques.

📌 Overview

This project detects violent scenes in videos by analyzing motion patterns between frames and training a classifier on extracted features.

The system follows this pipeline:
📹 Video Reading
🎥 Motion Detection
📊 Feature Extraction
🤖 Model Training
🔎 Violence Prediction
